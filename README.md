## 🎮 Project Demo: 2D Platformer Game in Java

This project is a 2D platformer game developed in **Java**, featuring classic game mechanics like character movement, enemy interactions, collectible coins, and collision detection.  
The architecture follows an object-oriented design, making it modular and easy to scale.

🔧 **Key Components Used (as seen in the video):**
- 🧱 **Tile-based level system** using `tiles.png` and other custom sprite sheets
- 🎮 **Player mechanics**: Movement, jumping, gravity handling (`Player.java`)
- 👾 **Enemy behavior**: Managed via `EnemyManager.java`, with different enemy sprites
- 💰 **Coin collection system**: Implemented with `CoinManager.java`
- 🧠 **Helper utilities**: Custom methods in `HelpMethods.java` for core logic
- 🔄 **Game loop** and rendering via `GamePanel.java` and `Main.java`
- 📁 **File handling** for resources like sprites, levels, and configuration
- 🖼️ Custom-designed sprite assets: `player_sprites.png`, `enemy01.png`, `stone.png`, etc.
